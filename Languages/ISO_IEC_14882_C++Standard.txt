C++ Its a thing

but anyways 
C++ as a language is a programming language that is an implementation of c and also includes additional data-types,
templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management operators
and additional library facilities

3 Terms and Definitions
|||

some definitions that are probably used a lot in the text, just copying pasting pretty much

access:
	-(execution-time): to read or modify the value of an object

argument:
	-(function call expression): expression in the comma-seperated list bounded by the parentheses? what does this mean?
	-(function-like macro): sequence of preprocessing tokens in comma-seperated list bounded by the parentheses
	-(throw expression): the operand of throw?!?!?!?!
	-(template instantiation): constant-expression, type-id, or id-expression in comma-seperated list bounded by the angle brackets
block:
	-a thread of execution that blocks is waiting for some condition to happen before execution (ie a code block is a section of code that is dependent on some sort of condition from another portion of code)
conditionally-supported:
	-construct that is not necessary for a language to be compliant to the standard
diagnostic message:
	-message defined by implementations for the implementations output messages
dynamic type:
	-(glvalue) the type of the most derived object, i think this means the ultra-parent or the most parent of any child class
	-(prvalue) static type of the prvalue expression!?!??!?!?!
ill-formed program:
	-ill thing
implementation-defined behavior:
	-behavior of an implementation taht the implementation documents
implementation-limits:
	-restrictions placed on programs by the implementation
locale-specific behavior:
	-local convention behavior, not even defined by the implementation but could just be a convention held by a specific ocmpany or something
multibyte character:
	-seuqence of one or more bytes that represents a memebr of extended characters for an execution enviroment
parameter:
	-(function or catch clause): object or reference declared as part of function or in the catch clause of an exception handler that acquires a value
	on entry to the function or handler
	-(function-lie macro): identifier from the comma-seperated list bounded by the parentheses immediately after following the macro name
	-(template): member of a template-parameter-list
signature:
	-(funnction): name and parameter list and enclosing namespace
	-(function template): ^ same and return type and template parameter list
	-(function template specialization): signature of the template of which it is a specialization and its template arguments
	-(class member function): name, parameter type list, and class it is member of, cv-qualifiers, and ref-qualifier
	-(class member function template): name, parameter tpye list, calss of which is a member, cv-qualifiers, ref-qualifier, return type, and template parameter list
static type:
	-type of expressionr esulting from analysis of the program without considering execution semantics
unblock:
	-satisfy the condition of a block
undefined behavior:
	-behaviro that the internation standard imposes no requirements
unspecified behavior:
	-behavior that a well formm program that depends on implementation, that different implementations can have different behavior
well-formed program:
	program that follwos all syntax rules and on definition rule
