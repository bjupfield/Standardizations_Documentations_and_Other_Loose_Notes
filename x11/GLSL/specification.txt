okay thing is normal c/c++ with a few added stuff, obviously also working on vertexes not cpus...


out -> linkage out of shader to subsequent stage, this variable is copied out and accessible in the next stages of the vertex
in -> linkage from a previous stage, this variable is copied from a previous out variable
uniform -> value is the same across all processes
varying -> value changes over preocesses, equivalent to out in vertex shader and in on fragment shader
buffer -> value is stored in buffer and can be written by api and shader stuff
shared -> compute shader only?

input variables are declared with the in storage qualifer, and they must be declared in global scope
i think this means for a shader

//shader.shade=>
//
//in int gaben;
//
//main(shadermain)
//{
//	return gaben;
//}
//

this would
declare a input variable of type int that is named gaben, i dont know how to link input to previous output though
input variables cannot be written to

okay outputs are declared in the same way but are written to instead of readonly

locations are declerations that allow the access of input from previous shader stages and even different program objects
i dont know how they do this though
okay for a non-vertex input to match an output from a previous shader stage the location layout qualifier must match
so location is used for non-vertex variables (global variables from the perspective of the gpu)
components can be used to pack more data into single locations, but obviously data is constrained by location
size, refer to sepcification pg 73 for more on this

interpolation qualifiers:
flat -> no interpolation
smooth -> perspective correct manner
noperspective -> linearly

default precisions for types can be delared with
precision precision-qualifier type

use
#pragma STDGL invariat(all)
to set all output variables to invariant

coherent is the qualifier used on images to say this image is being changed and accesed my multiple shaders
section 7.12 defines memory access

currently on 6.1

c-style function declerations
function overloading is implemented
void main()
{
}
is the entry point to the shader logic

parameters can use these keywords to determine the reference type of the parameter
in -> parameter will be copied into function but will not be changed due to the logic of the function
out -> parameter will be copied out, so like c# out variable
inout -> combine both of the above terms, like c# ref variable
noparameter -> assumes in

subroutines are variable functions and they are declaerd with the keyword
subroutine

7.2 is something i think were interested in, at least mainly, maybe?

need to look at chapter 11 of the opengl specification, lot of stufff in there is referenced by this document

pg 182 gives functions for using cordinates to find texture samples
cam do simple projections with linear division on texutres, pg 183

noise functions are depreceated

image writing is on pg 201

barrier() or stop points in the shader are defiend on pg 205-208
they are important for actually implementing multi-stage shaders
