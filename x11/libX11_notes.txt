|||CH 1 | Intro To XLib:

Xlib is the library that allows interaction between client and server of an x lib application

Xlibs structure is as follows

Display
	Screen1 - ScreenN
		Root1 - RootN
			ChildWindow1 - ChildWindowN
				ChildOfChild....
			Graphics Context
	Mouse
	Keyboard
	Pixmaps

The display is just the collection of graphical interfaces the user has available that the server
can access, a SCREEN
A display also has one pointer (mouse) and one keyboard

Windows and pixmaps are both drawables, and xorg provides storage for pixmaps

Functions in xlib mostly add request to an output buffer so the X Server can handle these request

Clients are informed of events that they request to be informed of

Most user accessable functions in xlib start with X, and user accessable structs gneerally start with X too

||| CH 2 | Display Functions:

To access a display, which is the primary way to connect to an x server through xlib
the XOpenDisplay function is used, which opens a tcp connection (unless otherwise specificed)
to the server from the client
Once the display has been accessed macros and functions can be used to access the display
data from teh structure

If programming in C macros should be used, if not functions are the way to retrieve
data from the server

Applications should not directly adjust the display or screen structures (for obvious reasons)
